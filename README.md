So, this is something that I just thought of while grinding in dank memer (its a discord bot if you don't know), (which was also when i just started learning python) and since most of the games on dank memer are fairly
simple. So, I thought of creating them myself and whcih later turned into a very big obsession of making it better. Which grew all the time. So, this the final thing.

At first I started by using classes which was a complete disaster, and later turned to simple functions, whcich are indeed much more efficient and simple to 
understand. 

So, this is just a small tkinter app that consists of the three games "Higher-Lower", "Guess-The-Number" and "Snake-eyes" which are all luck based. 

And that is all there is to it.

And, and I have taken a few things straight from the internet for this mini-project and I do not claim that they are mine at all. 

So, yeah bye!!!
Have a good day <3
